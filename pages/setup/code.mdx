# Setting up Hitch on Your Local Machine

## Prerequisites

Before being able to run Hitch on your local machine, you will need to have the following already installed: 

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethanpaneraa/cs-394-hitch-project-documentation.git
```

2. Navigate to the `cs-394-hitch-project-documentation` directory:

```bash
cd cs-394-hitch-project-documentation
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the application:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.


## Envrioment Variables

In order to run the application, you will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. The `.env` file should contain the following variables:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL = YOUR_DEPLOYED_API_URL
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
```

In order to obtain the API keys you need to run the application, you will need to create a Google Cloud Platform project and enable the Google Maps JavaScript API. You can find more information on how to do this [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started).

In terms of running our API locally or on a deployed server, you will need to deploy the backend of the application to a server and use the URL of the server as the value for the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` variable. For our project, we used [Render](https://render.com/) to deploy the backend of the application as we found it to be the most straightforward and easy to use! 

## Database

You also need to have a PostgresSQL database either running locally or on a server. Again, for our project, we used Render to deploy the database as well since Render offers a managed PostgresSQL database service that is easy to use and connect to the backend of our application. You can find more information on how to deploy a PostgresSQL database on Render [here](https://render.com/docs/deploy-postgresql). For connecting to our database, we used the python library `psycopg2` to connect to the database and execute queries.
