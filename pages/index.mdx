# COMP_SCI 394 - Team Green - Hitch Documentation
 
Welcome to the Hitch documentation! This is a project for Northwestern University's COMP_SCI 394 Spring 2024 course. This is Team Green's documentation for the project [Hitch](https://cs394-42dec.web.app/). 

## Getting Started

To get started with Hitch, you can visit the [Hitch website](https://cs394-42dec.web.app/) and create an account using your Northwestern Email. Once you have an account, you can begin to book rideshare trips with other Northwestern students! We hope that you enjoy using Hitch and find it to be a useful tool for getting around campus/the Chicagoland area.
